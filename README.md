# [Problem: #21 Amicable Numbers Benchmark using C, Go and Rust](https://projecteuler.net/problem=21)

## Description:

This is a benchmark between `C`, `Go`, and `Rust`.

Algorithm was inspired by [this code](https://github.com/jangidkrishna/100_days_of_algo/blob/master/day_27_amicable_numbers.go).

### Notes:

1. Here the focus is on similar algorithm rather than the most efficient one.
2. Build instructions are mentioned in `run.cmd`.
6. `bench.txt` is the output generated after running `run.cmd`. [`hyperfine`](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine) was used to run benchmarks.
